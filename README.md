# Abalone
Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements

## Description
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope - a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.

## Problem
The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

## Target
Rings: Discrete,	+1.5 gives the age in years

## Features (8)
Sex:	Categorical

Length:	Continuous, mm

Diameter: Continuous,	perpendicular to length	mm

Height: Continuous,	with meat in shell	mm

Whole_weight: Continuous,	grams

Shucked_weight: Continuous,	weight of meat	grams

Viscera_weight: Continuous,	gut weight (after bleeding)	grams

Shell_weight: Continuous,	after being dried	grams
